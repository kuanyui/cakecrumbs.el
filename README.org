** Known Issues
- I'm too lazy to implement the supporting for nested-tag of Jade/Pug.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Because this is still a valid nested-tag:
  #+BEGIN_SRC jade
   a(ng-class="aClass"
     ng-click="apply()"): b(ng-repeat="x in xxx"
                            ng-model="b"): c hello
  #+END_SRC
#+END_QUOTE
- =mmm-mode= may disable =cakecrumb-mode= after =cakecrumb-mode= enabling. I don't know how to deal with this currently.
- Huge XML/HTML file may cause freeze.
- Didn't named =breadcrumbs= because that had been used by someone else.
- Life is so painful.
